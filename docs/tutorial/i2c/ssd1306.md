# SSD1306

_This guide is written for the [PMSA003 Air Monitoring HAT for Raspberry Pi](https://thepihut.com/products/air-monitoring-hat-for-raspberry-pi-pmsa003) and assumes you've already connected it to your Pi. It only covers the OLED display, not the PMS._

## Install dependencies and fonts

```sh
pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-ssd1306
```

The rendering library [needs a specific font](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_framebuf/blob/043d8a75004d81e0326a6ac42ca4f71d1de94ac4/adafruit_framebuf.py#L383
).

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_framebuf/main/examples/font5x8.bin
```

## Show a count of readings sent

See [examples/i2c/ssd1306.py](../../examples/i2c/ssd1306.py) for an example of this.

Adafruit have provided some great APIs for OLED displays and there are many possible visualisations. Snsary doesn't provide any special code for working with OLED displays as outputs.
